# My Custom Media Player
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This application is just like a regular media player. But i have added my own touch.
The list of things it should be able to do when it's finished is the following:
    <ul>
        <li> <i>Create playlists</i>
        <li> <i>Shuffle songs</i>
        <li> <i>Specify an order of shuffling the songs</i>
        <li> <i>Specify a custom time to pause the song and skip to the next song</i>
    </ul>
